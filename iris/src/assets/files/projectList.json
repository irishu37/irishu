                "As part of the university course, CMSC434, I worked with four other friends to build this Android app. Through this project, we all did Android development for the first time. :)",
                "The motivation behind this app idea was simple: we, as students, wanted a safe place to buy and sell things. Students currently use Craigslist, Reddit, Facebook Marketplace, or Facebook Groups to exchange goods and services, but none of them provide a dedicated platform just for students. Craigslist is shady and outdated, Reddit is not customized for buying and selling, Facebook Marketplace is too broad in reach, and Facebook Groups yield little to no success since nobody really checks them.",
                "Our app is a way to provide that specialized-for-students platform. Users log in through their university's login portal to guarantee that everyone on the app are students. This way, students know they will be buying from or selling to another student (safer than Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace), and they can easily search and filter through existing posts (functionality not available on Reddit or Facebook Groups)."

                "Fake news is sadly very prevalent in the era we live in; people even go so far as to create fake Twitter tweets from verified accounts. In order to combat this and provide a platform to keep a check on these fake news, we build a lightweight web app that is capable of distinguishing between real and fake images of Tweets.",
                "We used Google's Vision API in order to parse text off of the images and then submitted to Twitter for validation. If the tweet was real, our web app would display the embedded tweet on the results page so that users could easily navigate directly to the real tweet.",
                "But our app isn't perfect: it struggles with busy images that have text other than that in the tweet or text in other languages. In addition, since the Twitter API cost too much money for us to use, we settled on web scraping after submitting an advanced search query directly on Twitter.com. If we had more time and resources, we would definitely have worked to cover more edge cases and utilize the API to submit queries.",

When the user hits an obstacle a prompt pops up with a question related to education to help the user better understand the lives of the girls represented in the game."
