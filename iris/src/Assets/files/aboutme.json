        "Hey, welcome to my website! I'm currently a rising senior studying Computer Science, and I built this website to better showcase who I am. I started out tweaking small chunks of HTML and CSS for my DeviantArt profile page back in middle school, and now I can't believe I'm almost ready to wrap up my educational journey and set foot into industry. But no matter where I am, my goal will always be to keep learning.",
        "Outside of school and work, you can find me bopping to k-pop songs, playing volleyball, or waiting for the next Breath of the Wild game to come out.",
        "If you're interested in getting to know me a little better, send me an email!"
